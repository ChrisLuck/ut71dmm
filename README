                  Uni-T UT71C DMM-Software for GNU / Linux
                            2014 Christian LÃ¼ck


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What this software is supposed to do:

 Reads data from meter and prints it to stdout in a comma-separated format.
 This data can be imported with libreoffice or for example octave
 to get graphical representations.

 This software is designed for the USB-datacable with the following hardware:
 IC-imprint:         "WCH CH9325"
 lsusb information:  "QinHeng Electronics HID-based serial adapater"
                     idVendor  : 0x1a86
                     idProduct : 0xe008

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported Hardware:

 1) Tested:
	Uni-T UT71C
 2) Might also work for:
	Uni-T UT71A/B/C/E
        Voltcraft VC-920 and VC-940

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This SW is based on the work of the following persons (thanks!):

 Rainer Wetzel (http://diyftw.de/wiki/doku.php?id=projekte:ut61e)
 Ralf Burger (http://www.erste.de/UT61/index.html)
 Alan Ott (http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile:

 1) cd into the directory where you found this readme (and the sourcefiles)
 2) clone hidapi: git clone git://github.com/signal11/hidapi.git
 3) make

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

    unfortunately hw access is required -> sudo

  - Note, that the cable is a bit buggy and might refuse to work correctly.
    To fix this, you can execute the 'cablefix.sh' script which suspends the
    cable.
    Thanks to Ralf Burger, who discovered this bug + workaround.
    Further information about this: http://erste.de/UT61/index.html

  - only 1 interface cable connected, autodetect:
        sudo ./ut71dmm

  - multiple interface cables connected, use first cable:
        sudo ./ut71dmm

  - multiple cables, find out the available adresses:
        lsusb | grep 1a86:e008

    will output the available devices:
        Bus 002 Device 032: ID 1a86:e008 QinHeng Electronics ...
        Bus 002 Device 031: ID 1a86:e008 QinHeng Electronics ...

    Bus X Device Y converts to XXXX:YYYY:00, with X and Y in hex

    now a specific device can be used by:
        sudo ./ut71dmm 0002:0020:00
